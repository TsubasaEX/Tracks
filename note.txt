Hi Zach,

我這邊在Azure 開了一個Azure Container Registry服務
Server: adveiss.azurecr.io
Username: adveiss
Password: zSYrKLBDiBAXNw3T9Y3LNX8sSpy76G/S

目前在Docker hub的image請Owner自行重新打tag上傳做版本控管
Tag前面名稱必須為adveiss.azurecr.io
下面是使用範例
Instructions for Getting Started
1.	1
Install Docker
Before you can try out the Azure Container Registry, you should install Docker.
Refer to the Mac or Windows or Linux getting started instructions for Docker.
2.	2
Run the "hello-world" base image
The following command will get you a running container straight off Docker Hub.
This should display "Hello from Docker!".
1.	docker run -it hello-world
3.	3
Login to your container registry
Let's login to your container registry. You can get the login URI and credentials from Access keys blade.
1.	docker login adveiss.azurecr.io
4.	4
Push to your registry
Let's first prefix the image with your registry login URI so that it can be pushed to your private registry.
The first command tags the image for uploading to your registry and the second pushes the image.
1.	docker tag hello-world adveiss.azurecr.io/hello-world
2.	docker push adveiss.azurecr.io/hello-world
5.	5
Pull from your registry
Let's try to pull the image from your registry. You should find that your image is up to date.
1.	docker pull adveiss.azurecr.io/hello-world
